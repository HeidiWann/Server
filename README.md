# Server
Main starts the program and the architecture is according to MVC. The web scraping process do not need to be started for the server to run.

When opening the code in IntelliJ, there will be errors in the code since this project also uses JavaFX. Please refer to the
Client READ.ME to see how to connect the project to JavaFX.

You may also need to download Selenium-4.21.0 and postgressql-42.7.3 and add these to the project's library. 

You will also need to add information for the pgAdmin sign in.

This project is connected with the Client prodject https://github.com/HeidiWann/Client.git
